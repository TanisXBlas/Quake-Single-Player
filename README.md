# The Temple of Hatred
Several years after the Warrior of Fire conquered this world and summoned his monsters to lay waste to its inhabitants, he vanished without a trace and let his monsters take control. You, a lone ranger, decide to venture up to his temple and destroy his rift, which continues to spawn more of his creations. The temple, once a burning beacon of hope, has become a frozen, deathly reminder of the atrocities the Warrior of Fire has brought. Destroy the rift and help save this world!
